Question 1. 
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.















Question 2.
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: false

 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 231 - 1










Question 3.
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true

 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109





























Question 4.
Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "guvi"
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: s = "geeks"
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1

 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only lowercase English letters.

















Question 5.
You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.
We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.
Return the reformatted license key.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

Example 2:
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of English letters, digits, and dashes '-'.
1 <= k <= 104
